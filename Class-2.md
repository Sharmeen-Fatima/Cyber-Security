## 💻 What is Cyber?
**Cyber** refers to anything related to **computers, networks, or the internet**.  
Examples: websites, mobile apps, servers, and cloud systems.

---

## 🛡️ What is Security?
**Security** means protecting valuable data and systems from harm, misuse, or unauthorized access.  
Examples: using passwords, firewalls, encryption, and secure authentication.

---

### **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**

GUI is **the visual screen you interact with on a computer or mobile**, where you click on **buttons, icons, menus, and windows** instead of typing commands.

**Example:**
When you open **Windows**, click **Start Menu**, open apps with icons — **that is GUI**.

---

### **One-Line Definition:**

👉 **GUI is a user-friendly visual interface that lets you use a computer by clicking instead of typing commands.**

---

### **Simple Comparison:**

| Type    | Example                                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **GUI** | Click icons, buttons (Windows, Android, iPhone) |
| **CLI** | Typing commands in Terminal / CMD               |

---
### **CLI (Command Line Interface)**

CLI is a **text-based way to use a computer** where you **type commands** instead of clicking buttons.

You interact with the system using **commands**, not icons.

---

### **Simple Example:**

When you open **CMD (Command Prompt)** or **Terminal** and type things like:

```
ping google.com
dir
cd Desktop
```

— **that is CLI.**

---

### **One-Line Definition:**

👉 **CLI is an interface where you control the computer by typing commands.**

---

### **Easy Comparison:**

| Interface | How You Use It        | Example                         |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **GUI**   | Click buttons & icons | Windows, Android, iPhone        |
| **CLI**   | Type commands         | CMD, PowerShell, Linux Terminal |

---

### **Which is better for Ethical Hacking?**

👉 **CLI is better.**

### **Why?**

👉 Because it's **faster, more powerful, gives more control, and most hacking tools work in CLI.**

---

**Simple line:**
**Hackers use CLI because it gives more power and speed than GUI.**

---
### **📌 What is Linux?**

👉 **Linux is an operating system**, just like Windows or Mac, that runs your computer, server, or phone.

---

### **📌 Is Linux Open Source?**

✅ **Yes!**

* Its code is **free to see, modify, and share**.
* That’s why there are **so many Linux versions (distros)** like Ubuntu, Kali, Mint.

---

### **One-Line Summary:**

**Linux = Free and open-source OS that anyone can use and customize.**

---
### **📌 What is a Port?**

👉 A **port** is like a **door** on a computer that allows data to enter or leave.

**Example:**

* Website (HTTP) uses **Port 80**
* Login (SSH) uses **Port 22**

Just think:
**Computer has many doors, each door is used for a specific purpose.**

---

### **📌 What is a Protocol?**

👉 A **protocol** is **a rule or method that tells computers how to communicate**.

**Example:**

* HTTP → Rules for websites
* FTP → Rules for file transfer
* SMTP → Rules for sending emails

Just think:
**Protocol = Rules of communication**
**Port = Door used for that communication**

---

### **Simple Relation:**

| Protocol (Rules) | Port (Door) |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| HTTP             | Port 80     |
| HTTPS            | Port 443    |
| SSH              | Port 22     |
