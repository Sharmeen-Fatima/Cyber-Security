## 📌 Definition of Network

A network is an interconnected device system.

---

The OSI (Open System Interconnection) model was developed by the  
**International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** in **1984**.

---

## 🔌 7. Physical Layer

**Definition**  
Defines physical data transmission.

**Example**  
Cat5, Cat6, RJ45

**Purpose**  
Establishes the physical infrastructure.

---

## 🔗 6. Data Link Layer

**Definition**  
Provides error-free transport of data frames.

**Example**  
Ethernet, Switch, MAC Address

**Purpose**  
Provides error detection, correction, and data framing.

---

## 🌍 5. Network Layer

**Definition**  
Routes data between different networks.

**Example**  
IP Address, Routers

**Purpose**  
Provides segmentation and establishes connection and teardown.

---

## 🚚 4. Transport Layer

**Definition**  
Provides reliable data transfer between devices.

**Example**  
TCP and UDP

---

## 🔐 3. Session Layer

**Definition**  
Establishes, maintains, terminates, and reconnects sessions.

**Example**  
Zoom, AnyDesk, SSH, RedBIOS

---

## 🎨 2. Presentation Layer

**Definition**  
Converts data into a format understandable by the receiving device.

**Example**  
Encryption, Decryption

**Purpose**  
Provides data encryption, compression, and formatting.

---

## 🖥️ 1. Application Layer

**Definition**  
Provides services and interfaces for web applications.
