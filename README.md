# 🔐 Cyber Security — Simplified Overview

Welcome to this brief guide on **Cyber Security** 🧠  
This README explains — in simple and professional terms — what Cyber Security is, the roles of **Blue & Red Teams**, what **Threats** and **Vulnerabilities** mean, and the most **common types of cyberattacks**.

## 💻 What is Cyber?
**Cyber** refers to anything related to **computers, networks, or the internet**.  
Examples: websites, mobile apps, servers, and cloud systems.

## 🛡️ What is Security?
**Security** means protecting valuable data and systems from harm, misuse, or unauthorized access.  
Examples: using passwords, firewalls, encryption, and secure authentication.

## 🔵 Blue Team vs 🔴 Red Team

- **🔴 Red Team**  
  Ethical hackers who simulate real-world attacks to test how secure a system is.  
  Their mission: find weaknesses before real attackers do.

- **🔵 Blue Team**  
  The defenders who monitor, detect, and respond to attacks.  
  Their mission: strengthen systems and prevent breaches.

## ⚠️ Threats & Vulnerabilities

- **🧨 Threat:**  
  Any potential danger that could exploit a weakness and cause damage (e.g., hackers, malware, phishing).

- **🕳️ Vulnerability:**  
  A flaw or weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat (e.g., outdated software, weak passwords, poor configurations).

## 💥 Common Types of Cyber Attacks

1. **🎣 Phishing**  
   Fake emails or websites trick users into sharing sensitive information.  
   *🛡️ Prevention:* Verify sources and avoid clicking unknown links.

2. **🐛 Malware**  
   Malicious software (viruses, ransomware, spyware) that damages or steals data.  
   *🛡️ Prevention:* Keep antivirus tools updated and don’t download unknown files.

3. **🌐 Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)**  
   Flooding a server or network with traffic to make it unavailable.  
   *🛡️ Prevention:* Use firewalls, CDNs, and traffic filters.

4. **👂 Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**  
   Intercepting communication between two parties to steal or alter data.  
   *🛡️ Prevention:* Use HTTPS/SSL and avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks.

5. **💾 SQL Injection**  
   Inserting malicious code into a website’s database query to access or change data.  
   *🛡️ Prevention:* Validate all inputs and use prepared statements.

6. **🔑 Password Attacks**  
   Trying to guess or steal passwords through brute force or dictionary attacks.  
   *🛡️ Prevention:* Use strong passwords, enable 2FA, and use a password manager.

7. **🎭 Social Engineering**  
   Tricking people into revealing confidential data or performing risky actions.  
   *🛡️ Prevention:* Always verify identities and think before sharing information.
