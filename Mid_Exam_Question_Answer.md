Tracert shows the **path (hops)** packets take to reach a destination 📍

---

### Q5. Which protocol is used by tracert? 🔁

**Answer:**
Tracert uses **ICMP with TTL values** ⏳

---

### Q6. Ping vs Tracert? ⚔️

**Answer:**
Ping checks **connectivity** ✅, tracert shows **network path** 🗺️

---

### Q7. What is TTL? ⌛

**Answer:**
TTL limits how many **hops** a packet can travel 🌍

---

### Q8. Why is ping important in cyber security? 🔐

**Answer:**
It checks **host availability** and ICMP filtering 🚦

---

### Q9. Why is tracert important in cyber security? 🛡️

**Answer:**
It helps find **routing issues and suspicious hops** 🚨

---

### Q10. What does `ping -t` do? 🔄

**Answer:**
It sends ping requests **continuously** until stopped ✋

---

### Q11. What does `tracert -d` do? ⚡

**Answer:**
It makes tracing **faster** by skipping hostname resolution 🚀

---

### Q12. What does packet loss mean? 📉

**Answer:**
It indicates **network congestion or firewall blocking** 🔥

---

### Q13. Can ping be blocked? 🚫

**Answer:**
Yes, firewalls often block ICMP to stop scanning 🧱

---

### Q14. What is reconnaissance? 🕵️‍♂️

**Answer:**
Collecting information about a target network 📂

---

### Q15. Ping & tracert in reconnaissance? 🔍

**Answer:**
Ping finds **live hosts** 🟢, tracert maps **network paths** 🗺️

---

### Q16. What do `-4` and `-6` mean? 🔢

**Answer:**
`-4` = IPv4 🌐 | `-6` = IPv6 🚀

---

### Q17. What does high latency indicate? 🐢

**Answer:**
Network **delay or congestion** ⏱️

---

### Q18. Is tracert active scanning? 🎯

**Answer:**
Yes, it actively sends packets 🔁

---

### Q19. Why monitor ICMP traffic? 👀

**Answer:**
To detect **scanning, abuse, or attacks** 🚨

---

### Q20. Exam Golden Tip ⭐

**Answer:**
Ping = **Availability** ✅
Tracert = **Path analysis** 🛣️
Both = **ICMP based** 📡

---

### Q21. What does `ipconfig` do? 🌐

**Answer:** Shows your computer’s **IP address, subnet mask, and gateway** 📡

---

### Q22. What is the purpose of `ping`? 📡

**Answer:** Checks if a host or website is **reachable and responding** ✅

---

### Q23. What does `ping -t` do? 🔄

**Answer:** Continuously pings a host until you **manually stop it** ✋

---

### Q24. What is `tracert` used for? 🛣️

**Answer:** Shows the **network path (hops)** packets take to reach a destination 📍

---

### Q25. What does `tasklist` show? 📋

**Answer:** Displays all **currently running processes** on your system 🖥️

---

### Q26. What is `taskkill` used for? ❌

**Answer:** Terminates a running process by **name or ID** 🛑

---

### Q27. Difference: `taskkill /pid (PID)` vs `/f /pid (PID)` 🎯🔥

**Answer:**

* `/pid` → Stops a process using its Process ID
* `/f /pid` → **Forcefully stops** a process using its PID

---

### Q28. What does `netstat` do? 🌐

**Answer:** Shows all **active network connections** on your computer

---

### Q29. What does `netstat -ao` show? 👀

**Answer:** Shows network connections along with their **associated Process IDs (PID)**

---

### Q30. What is `systeminfo`? 🧾

**Answer:** Displays detailed **system and operating system information**

---

### Q31. What does `wmic` do? ⚙️

**Answer:** Provides information about **system, hardware, and running processes**

---

### Q32. What does `ver` command show? 🪟

**Answer:** Displays the **Windows version** installed on the system

---

### Q33. What is `hostname`? 🏷️

**Answer:** Shows the **name of the computer**

---

### Q34. What does `whoami` do? 👤

**Answer:** Shows the **currently logged-in user**

---

### Q35. What does `time` command do? ⏰

**Answer:** Displays or sets the **system time**

---

### Q36. What does `date` command do? 📅

**Answer:** Displays or sets the **system date**

---

### 🔐 Cyber Security Exam Tips ⭐

* Use `ping` & `tracert` for **network troubleshooting & reconnaissance** 🌐
* Use `tasklist` & `taskkill` to **monitor/stop suspicious processes** 🖥️
* Use `systeminfo`, `wmic`, `hostname`, `whoami` for **system enumeration** 🕵️‍♀️
* Use `netstat -ao` to **track network connections and identify malicious processes** 👀
