### Q1. What is `ping`? 🖥️

**Answer:**
Ping is a command used to check if a system is reachable or not ✅

---

### Q2. Which protocol does ping use? 🌐

**Answer:**
Ping uses **ICMP** 📡

---

### Q3. What does ping show? 📊

**Answer:**
It shows **connectivity, response time, and packet loss** ⏱️❌

---

### Q4. What is `tracert`? 🛣️

**Answer:**
Tracert shows the **path (hops)** packets take to reach a destination 📍

---

### Q5. Which protocol is used by tracert? 🔁

**Answer:**
Tracert uses **ICMP with TTL values** ⏳

---

### Q6. Ping vs Tracert? ⚔️

**Answer:**
Ping checks **connectivity** ✅, tracert shows **network path** 🗺️

---

### Q7. What is TTL? ⌛

**Answer:**
TTL limits how many **hops** a packet can travel 🌍

---

### Q8. Why is ping important in cyber security? 🔐

**Answer:**
It checks **host availability** and ICMP filtering 🚦

---

### Q9. Why is tracert important in cyber security? 🛡️

**Answer:**
It helps find **routing issues and suspicious hops** 🚨

---

### Q10. What does `ping -t` do? 🔄

**Answer:**
It sends ping requests **continuously** until stopped ✋

---

### Q11. What does `tracert -d` do? ⚡

**Answer:**
It makes tracing **faster** by skipping hostname resolution 🚀

---

### Q12. What does packet loss mean? 📉

**Answer:**
It indicates **network congestion or firewall blocking** 🔥

---

### Q13. Can ping be blocked? 🚫

**Answer:**
Yes, firewalls often block ICMP to stop scanning 🧱

---

### Q14. What is reconnaissance? 🕵️‍♂️

**Answer:**
Collecting information about a target network 📂

---

### Q15. Ping & tracert in reconnaissance? 🔍

**Answer:**
Ping finds **live hosts** 🟢, tracert maps **network paths** 🗺️

---

### Q16. What do `-4` and `-6` mean? 🔢

**Answer:**
`-4` = IPv4 🌐 | `-6` = IPv6 🚀

---

### Q17. What does high latency indicate? 🐢

**Answer:**
Network **delay or congestion** ⏱️

---

### Q18. Is tracert active scanning? 🎯

**Answer:**
Yes, it actively sends packets 🔁

---

### Q19. Why monitor ICMP traffic? 👀

**Answer:**
To detect **scanning, abuse, or attacks** 🚨

---

### Q20. Exam Golden Tip ⭐

**Answer:**
Ping = **Availability** ✅
Tracert = **Path analysis** 🛣️
Both = **ICMP based** 📡
