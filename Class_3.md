### **2️⃣ Session ID**

A Session ID is a unique code that identifies your current visit to a website.

Its purpose:

* to know which user is active
* to keep you logged in temporarily
* to track your activity for that session only

When the session expires, you must log in again.

### **3️⃣ Tokens**

A Token is a secure digital key or proof of identity used in modern authentication systems.

Types used in Google login:

* **ID Token** → proves your identity
* **Access Token** → grants permission to access your Google data
* **Refresh Token** → renews access when the token expires

Tokens are more secure than simple session IDs.
