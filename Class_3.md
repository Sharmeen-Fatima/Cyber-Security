## Q1: When you log in to your Google account on any PC, what things get generated?

---

A:

1. Session ID
2. Tokens
3. Cookies

---
#### Let me Explain.

---

### **2️⃣ Session ID**

A Session ID is a unique code that identifies your current visit to a website.

Its purpose:

* to know which user is active
* to keep you logged in temporarily
* to track your activity for that session only

When the session expires, you must log in again.

---

### **3️⃣ Tokens**

A Token is a secure digital key or proof of identity used in modern authentication systems.

Types used in Google login:

* **ID Token** → proves your identity
* **Access Token** → grants permission to access your Google data
* **Refresh Token** → renews access when the token expires

Tokens are more secure than simple session IDs.

---

### **1️⃣ Cookies**

Cookies are small text files stored in your browser.
They are used to:

* remember your login
* store your preferences
* keep you signed in
* track your active session

**Example:**
You stay logged into YouTube because the cookie stores your login info.

---
* **Session ID:** Identifies your active session.
* **Tokens:** Secure identity and access keys.
* **Cookies:** Store login and preferences.

Here is a clean, professional, and easy-to-understand **table with examples** for all terms you shared:
