# 🆚 Ping vs Tracert (Windows Command Comparison)

This repository explains the **difference between `ping` and `tracert` commands** in a **simple and easy way**, specially for **Cyber Security Fundamentals students**.

---

## 🔹 What is Ping?

`ping` is a network command used to **check whether a system is reachable or not** and how fast it responds.

Example:

```cmd
ping google.com
```

---

## 🔹 What is Tracert?

`tracert` (Trace Route) is a network command used to **show the path (hops)** that packets take to reach a destination.

Example:

```cmd
tracert google.com
```

| Feature            | Ping                | Tracert                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Purpose            | Checks connectivity | Shows network path         |
| Shows Hops         | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes                      |
| Response Time      | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No                       |
| Detects Delay      | Basic               | Detailed per hop           |
| Troubleshooting    | Simple issues       | Routing & path issues      |
| Used ICMP          | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes                      |
| Cyber Security Use | Availability check  | Network mapping & analysis |

## 🔐 Cyber Security Perspective

### 🔹 Ping is used for:

* Checking if a host is **alive or down**
* Basic **network availability testing**
* Detecting **blocked ICMP traffic**

### 🔹 Tracert is used for:

* Identifying **packet drop locations**
* Finding **suspicious or unknown network hops**
* Understanding **network routing & topology**
* Basic **reconnaissance**

---

## 🔹 When to Use What?

* Use **Ping** when you want to quickly check **connectivity**
* Use **Tracert** when Ping fails or when you want to know **where the problem is**

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* Understand core networking commands
* Build strong foundation for **Cyber Security**
* Prepare for **interviews & certifications**
